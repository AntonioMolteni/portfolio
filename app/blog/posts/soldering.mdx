I love electronics projects whether it be fixing old electronics, soldering wires or, making my own designs. While I was in college, I tried a variety of different soldering irons in various labs and engineering clubs. I ended up soldering a lot of stuff like PCB assembly and rework, wire soldering. I had a cheap soldering iron and it will get the job done. The cheap soldering iron was always way too hot or way too cold. Weller and hacko benchtop irons are an improvement but the best soldering iron I have ever used was the metcal for its temperature control.

## Soldering Iron

After using this soldering Iron in a lab at school I decided immediately I had to purchase one. It heats up in seconds and has almost instantaneous temperature response. This comes most in handy when soldering on large boards with large ground planes that can sink heat a lot of heat. The iron responds and delivers more energy but without getting too hot. This soldering iron makes soldering components like inductors super easy.

## Desoldering Gun

Because I loved the soldering Iron so much, I also purchased the desoldeirng gun, and the hot air gun. The desoldering gun comes in handy when you want to remove a bunch of through hole components however it requires an air compressor and is probably more hassle that it is work. The Hot air station on the other hand is amazing. You can use it for heatshrink or soldering surface mount integrated circuits

## Hot Air Gun

## Extras

mention flux and solder wick.
