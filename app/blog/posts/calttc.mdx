I played table tennis in high school and when I came to college I wanted to continue playing. Doing a quick google search for table tennis clubs on campus. I was unable to see any of the pertinent information like the playing schedule or how to join as all of the information was outdated and the website was very slow. The purpose of this project is to fix this problem.

Before starting this project, I knew very little about web development and I made it a challenge to create a solid website using simply html and css as an exercise. This website outperformed the previous sites load times and was much better. Looking back I made some pretty obvious mistakes but I learned a lot: Here is a video of that site:
